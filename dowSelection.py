-------------

Topics: Boolean array operators, sum function, where function.

The array 'dow' is a 2-D array with each row holding the
daily performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from the
beginning of 2008 (dates have been removed for exercise simplicity).
The array has the following structure::

       OPEN      HIGH      LOW       CLOSE     VOLUME      ADJ_CLOSE
       13261.82  13338.23  12969.42  13043.96  3452650000  13043.96
       13044.12  13197.43  12968.44  13056.72  3429500000  13056.72
       13046.56  13049.65  12740.51  12800.18  4166000000  12800.18
       12801.15  12984.95  12640.44  12827.49  4221260000  12827.49
       12820.9   12998.11  12511.03  12589.07  4705390000  12589.07
       12590.21  12814.97  12431.53  12735.31  5351030000  12735.31


1. Create a "mask" array that indicates which rows have a volume
   greater than 5.5 billion.
2. How many are there?
3. Find the index of every row (or day) where the volume is greater
   than 5.5 billion.
