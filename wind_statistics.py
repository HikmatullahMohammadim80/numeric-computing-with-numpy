Wind Statistics
----------------

Topics: Using array methods over different axes, fancy indexing.

1. The data in 'wind.data' has the following format::

        61  1  1 15.04 14.96 13.17  9.29 13.96  9.87 13.67 10.25 10.83 12.58 18.50 15.04
        61  1  2 14.71 16.88 10.83  6.50 12.62  7.67 11.50 10.04  9.79  9.67 17.54 13.83
        61  1  3 18.50 16.88 12.33 10.13 11.17  6.17 11.25  8.04  8.50  7.67 12.75 12.71

   The first three columns are year, month and day.  The
   remaining 12 columns are average windspeeds in knots at 12
   locations in Ireland on that day.

   Use the 'loadtxt' function from numpy to read the data into
   an array.

2. Calculate the min, max and mean windspeeds and standard deviation of the
   windspeeds over all the locations and all the times (a single set of numbers
   for the entire dataset).

3. Calculate the min, max and mean windspeeds and standard deviations of the
   windspeeds at each location over all the days (a different set of numbers
   for each location)

4. Calculate the min, max and mean windspeed and standard deviations of the
   windspeeds across all the locations at each day (a different set of numbers
   for each day)

5. Find the location which has the greatest windspeed on each day (an integer
   column number for each day).

6. Find the year, month and day on which the greatest windspeed was recorded.

7. Find the average windspeed in January for each location.

You should be able to perform all of these operations without using a for
loop or other looping construct.
